# TeamSync Project Flow Documentation

## Overview

The TeamSync project aims to develop a sophisticated backend system for project management and team collaboration. The flow of the project involves multiple stages from user management to task tracking and real-time collaboration. This document outlines the key components and interactions within the system.

## Project Flow

### **1. User Management**

**Purpose**: To handle user registration, authentication, and role management.

- **User Registration**: Users sign up by providing their details (name, email, password). The system stores these details in the `Users` table, with hashed passwords for security.
- **User Authentication**: Upon login, users provide their credentials. The system verifies these credentials and issues a JWT token for authenticated sessions.
- **Role Management**: Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Member) which define their access and permissions within the system.

### **2. Project Creation and Management**

**Purpose**: To manage projects, including creation, updates, and ownership.

- **Project Creation**: Users with appropriate roles can create new projects. Details are stored in the `Projects` table, including project name, description, and dates.
- **Project Updates**: Project details can be updated as needed. The `updated_at` timestamp reflects the most recent changes.
- **Project Ownership**: Projects are assigned to users (owners). This relationship is maintained in the `Projects` table and `Project Members` table for access control.

### **3. Task Management**

**Purpose**: To track tasks within projects, including assignments, statuses, and priorities.

- **Task Creation**: Tasks are created and associated with specific projects. Information such as task name, description, and due date is stored in the `Tasks` table.
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks can be assigned to users. This is reflected in the `assigned_to` field of the `Tasks` table.
- **Task Updates**: Task details, including status and priority, can be updated. The `updated_at` timestamp captures these changes.

### **4. Task Comments**

**Purpose**: To facilitate discussions and comments on tasks.

- **Adding Comments**: Users can add comments to tasks. These are stored in the `Task Comments` table, including the comment content and the user who made the comment.
- **Comment Management**: Comments are linked to tasks and users, allowing for threaded discussions and tracking of feedback.

### **5. User Interactions**

**Purpose**: To track and log user actions within the system for auditing and analysis.

- **Action Logging**: Actions performed by users (e.g., task updates, project changes) are recorded in the `User Interactions` table.
- **Details Capture**: Interaction details include the action performed, related task or project, and any additional information.

### **6. System Logs**

**Purpose**: To maintain a record of system activities, errors, and debugging information.

- **Log Entries**: System activities, errors, and significant events are logged in the `System Logs` table.
- **Log Levels**: Logs are categorized by severity (e.g., INFO, ERROR), helping with troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration and Login**:

   - Users sign up or log in.
   - System stores user data and issues JWT tokens upon successful authentication.

2. **Project and Task Management**:

   - Users create and manage projects and tasks.
   - Data is updated in the `Projects`, `Tasks`, and related tables.
   - Changes are reflected in real-time for users with appropriate access.

3. **Task Comments and Interactions**:

   - Comments are added to tasks and stored in the `Task Comments` table.
   - User interactions are logged for audit and analysis.

4. **System Logging**:
   - System logs record important events and errors.
   - Logs are stored in the `System Logs` table for ongoing monitoring.

## Conclusion

This project flow ensures a comprehensive management system for projects, tasks, and user interactions. By maintaining clear data relationships and logs, the system supports efficient project collaboration and management.
